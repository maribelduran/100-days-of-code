# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Styled twitch streamer statuses. Created a new meta div using vanilla js.

**Thoughts:** Today was my first day doing the 100 Days of Code challenge and didn't realize that working on FCC algorithms did not count as time coding. So I pushed myself to work on my Twitch Streamers App. I am currently working on styling the Twitch users' statuses and streaming information. It is taking me a little longer to complete because I am doing this using vanilla js.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Created a separate codepen to work on creating an overlay on single pens. Will be integrating the overlay to my Twitch Streamers App when completed.

**Thoughts**: I created single pens where I could work on creating overlays. The overlays will have a description of what the Twitch streamer is currently streaming. Still have work to do on getting the correct height for the thumbnails inside the pens, but the overlay is working properly.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to make single pens responsive.

**Thoughts**: Attempted to make the single pens responsive. However, adding flex display, is not allowing the width % to update as I want it to. Will look more into what display flex actually does.
