# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** Today was my first day doing the 100 Days of Code challenge and didn't realize that working on FCC algorithms did not count as time coding. So I pushed myself to work on my Twitch Streamers App. I am currently working on styling the Twitch users' statuses and streaming information. It is taking me a little longer to complete because I am doing this using vanilla js.

**Today's Progress**:  Styled twitch streamer status. Created a new meta div using vanilla js.

**Thoughts**: Today is my first day with starting
I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
