# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Styled twitch streamer statuses. Created a new meta div using vanilla js.

**Thoughts:** Today was my first day doing the 100 Days of Code challenge and didn't realize that working on FCC algorithms did not count as time coding. So I pushed myself to work on my Twitch Streamers App. I am currently working on styling the Twitch users' statuses and streaming information. It is taking me a little longer to complete because I am doing this using vanilla js.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Created a separate codepen to work on creating an overlay on single pens. Will be integrating the overlay to my Twitch Streamers App when completed.

**Thoughts**: I created single pens where I could work on creating overlays. The overlays will have a description of what the Twitch streamer is currently streaming. Still have work to do on getting the correct height for the thumbnails inside the pens, but the overlay is working properly.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to make single pens responsive.

**Thoughts**: Attempted to make the single pens responsive. However, adding flex display, is not allowing the width % to update as I want it to. Will look more into what display flex actually does.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Added wrapping to the flex container and made pens more mobile responsive.

**Thoughts**: Added wrapping to the flex container. This fixed the issue I was having yesterday where the width % was not changing on different media widths. Single pens are now more mobile responsive.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Experimented with different media queries for tablet and phone. Made pens more mobile responsive.

**Thoughts**: Was able to get my two new media queries to work on desktop. However, when I checked the app on my mobile device, the pens widths were not changing. I then realized that I had not yet included the <meta> viewport inside the head element. The issue was resolved after declaring the meta viewport onto my page.

### Day 8: January 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Merged single-pen-overlay project to Twitch Streamers App. Each single_channel item now contains an overlay that informs what is streaming.

**Thoughts**: My Twitch Streamers app is almost complete. Almost slacked today because I went to a Warriors Game, but managed to do an hour of coding.
