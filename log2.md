# 100 Days Of Code and Prep

### Day 1: Tuesday June 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Submitted solution to a take home test that consisted of merging log sources
* Researched FrontEnd Masters courses
* Worked on 2 CodeWars Problems
* Replied to recruiter emails
* Worked on personal website
* Read a little on SEO best practices


**Thoughts:** 
* I gave it my best shot on the take home test, but was not able to come up with a good solution. I created a readable stream object to read in the log sources since the source could be huge. However, I was not able to sort the entries together with the node module I was trying to implement. I was transparent with the recruiter about my efforts as well as the learning curve with streams. They provided feedback on my solution. All in all I know I gave it my best and it was good practice! 
* Looking into FrontEnd Master's Practical Algorithm's course!  https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/
**Link to practice problem:** [Friend or Foe?](http://www.codewars.com/kata/friend-or-foe/train/javascript)
**Link to practice problem:** [Duplicate Encoder](http://www.codewars.com/kata/duplicate-encoder/train/javascript)
* Researched Cloudflare
* Added the preload value to the link attribute for stylesheets. This improved mobile performanct at Google PageSpeed Insight. 
* Some notes on SEO best practices: HTTPS, have valuable content, use good meta description and title in head, mobile first ready, and create trust.
