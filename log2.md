# 100 Days Of Code and Prep

### Day 1: Tuesday June 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Submitted solution to a take home test that consisted of merging log sources
* Researched FrontEnd Masters courses
* Worked on 2 CodeWars Problems
* Replied to recruiter emails
* Worked on personal website
* Read a little on SEO best practices


**Thoughts:** 
* I gave it my best shot on the take home test, but was not able to come up with a good solution. I created a readable stream object to read in the log sources since the source could be huge. However, I was not able to sort the entries together with the node module I was trying to implement. I was transparent with the recruiter about my efforts as well as the learning curve with streams. They provided feedback on my solution. All in all I know I gave it my best and it was good practice! 
* Looking into FrontEnd Master's Practical Algorithm's course!  https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/

**Link to practice problem:** [Duplicate Encoder](http://www.codewars.com/kata/duplicate-encoder/train/javascript)
* Researched Cloudflare
* Added the preload value to the link attribute for stylesheets. This improved mobile performanct at Google PageSpeed Insight. 
* Some notes on SEO best practices: HTTPS, have valuable content, use good meta description and title in head, mobile first ready, and create trust.

### Day 2: Monday June 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Attended Building Performant Large-Scale React Apps & Embracing Public Speaking meetup


**Thoughts:** 
* Attended a @womenlevelup meetup which covered Building Performant Large-Scale React Apps & Embracing Public Speaking. Main points taken from this is to continue getting out of my comfort zone. Women do not apply for a job unless they meet 100% of the qualifications. There's so much to this statistic, by my take on this is that some of this has to do with lack of confidence, fear of failure, but most importantly misinterprentation of the hiring process. We shouldn't let lack of confidence or fear of failure hold us back from progressing. And Chromeâ€™s DevTools Performance tab is BAE. We can check the performance of a function or program through this awesome tab. We can also speed things up by computing less, rendering less. One thing that I can definitely work on is to have minimum knowledge component state trees on my React apps.

### Day 3: Tuesday June 26, 2018 - Thursday June 28, 218

**Today's Progress:**
* Submitted solution to a take home test that consisted of exporting historical weather data to Google Sheets

**Thoughts:** 
* I am so happy with how my solution and githuub README file turned out for this project. This project gave me an opportunity to show not only my programming abilities, but also my design abilities by developing a clean web app. I enjoyed being able to work with the Google Sheets API, an API I had never worked with which included having to setup OAuth 2.0 autentication. The best part of this project was writing the github README file. It allowed me to show my technical documentation skills and empathy toward other developers and users of my applications. Through this, I also learned to handle some errors during fetch api calls.

### Day 6 : Monday July 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Read articles on Binary Trees and Depth first Serach
* Worked on 1 CodeWars Problem
* Replied to recruiter's email with availability
* Signed up for Udemy's The Coding Interivew Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures course
* Cleaned up and backed up laptop

**Thoughts:** 
* Read about binary search tress and depth first search. My goal for this week is to implement a binary search including BFS and DFS traversal methods. I also attempted to provide a solution to Codewar's Default Argument's problem. I was asked to write a function that takes a function as an argument, along with an object containing default values for that function's arguments and return another function. I was in the right track about using the callback function to create a new function. However, i didn't how that I could use the Object.apply method to call in the default values if they were not set. I learned alot from this problem and next time I will be able to use the apply method to help with other solutions. It's all about practice! I also signed up for Udemy's Udemy's The Coding Interivew Bootcamp: Algorithsm + Data Structures course. However, I had to clear up my laptop last night to free up space in order for me to use my laptop again lol.
