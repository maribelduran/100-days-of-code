# 100 Days Of Code and Prep

### Day 1: Tuesday June 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Submitted solution to a take home test that consisted of merging log sources
* Researched FrontEnd Masters courses
* Worked on 2 CodeWars Problems
* Replied to recruiter emails
* Worked on personal website
* Read a little on SEO best practices


**Thoughts:** 
* I gave it my best shot on the take home test, but was not able to come up with a good solution. I created a readable stream object to read in the log sources since the source could be huge. However, I was not able to sort the entries together with the node module I was trying to implement. I was transparent with the recruiter about my efforts as well as the learning curve with streams. They provided feedback on my solution. All in all I know I gave it my best and it was good practice! 
* Looking into FrontEnd Master's Practical Algorithm's course!  https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/
**Link to practice problem:** [Friend or Foe?](http://www.codewars.com/kata/friend-or-foe/train/javascript)
**Link to practice problem:** [Duplicate Encoder](http://www.codewars.com/kata/duplicate-encoder/train/javascript)
* Researched Cloudflare
* Added the preload value to the link attribute for stylesheets. This improved mobile performanct at Google PageSpeed Insight. 
* Some notes on SEO best practices: HTTPS, have valuable content, use good meta description and title in head, mobile first ready, and create trust.

### Day 2: Monday June 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Attended Building Performant Large-Scale React Apps & Embracing Public Speaking meetup


**Thoughts:** 
* Attended a @womenlevelup meetup which covered Building Performant Large-Scale React Apps & Embracing Public Speaking. Main points taken from this is to continue getting out of my comfort zone. Women do not apply for a job unless they meet 100% of the qualifications. There's so much to this statistic, by my take on this is that some of this has to do with lack of confidence, fear of failure, but most importantly misinterprentation of the hiring process. We shouldn't let lack of confidence or fear of failure hold us back from progressing. And Chromeâ€™s DevTools Performance tab is BAE. We can check the performance of a function or program through this awesome tab. We can also speed things up by computing less, rendering less. One thing that I can definitely work on is to have minimum knowledge component state trees on my React apps.

### Day 3: Tuesday June 26, 2018 - Thursday June 28, 218

**Today's Progress:**
* Submitted solution to a take home test that consisted of exporting historical weather data to Google Sheets

**Thoughts:** 
* I am so happy with how my solution and githuub README file turned out for this project. This project gave me an opportunity to show not only my programming abilities, but also my design abilities by developing a clean web app. I enjoyed being able to work with the Google Sheets API, an API I had never worked with which included having to setup OAuth 2.0 autentication. The best part of this project was writing the github README file. It allowed me to show my technical documentation skills and empathy toward other developers and users of my applications. Through this, I also learned to handle some errors during fetch api calls.

### Day 6 : Monday July 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Read articles on Binary Trees and Depth first Serach
* Worked on 1 CodeWars Problem
* Replied to recruiter's email with availability
* Signed up for Udemy's The Coding Interivew Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures course
* Cleaned up and backed up laptop

**Thoughts:** 
* Read about binary search tress and depth first search. My goal for this week is to implement a binary search including BFS and DFS traversal methods. I also attempted to provide a solution to Codewar's Default Argument's problem. I was asked to write a function that takes a function as an argument, along with an object containing default values for that function's arguments and return another function. I was in the right track about using the callback function to create a new function. However, i didn't how that I could use the Object.apply method to call in the default values if they were not set. I learned alot from this problem and next time I will be able to use the apply method to help with other solutions. It's all about practice! I also signed up for Udemy's Udemy's The Coding Interivew Bootcamp: Algorithsm + Data Structures course. However, I had to clear up my laptop last night to free up space in order for me to use my laptop again lol.

### Day 8: Thursday July 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Continued The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures Course
* Phone call with Instacart

**Thoughts:** 
* Loving the course so far and enjoyed my conversation with Instacart!


### Day 10 - 12: Friday July 6, 2018 - Sunday July 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Continued The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures Course
* Listened to Syntax episode: Our Workflows: Design, Development, Git, Deployment
* Listened to Syntax episode; How To Get Better at Debugging

**Thoughts:** 
* Got really stuck with one of the Matrix problem, but ended up figuring it out. I'm excited that I'm starting to see how I can implement algorithms recursively. 



### Day 11: Monday July 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Continued The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures Course
* Read Algorithms To Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decision
* Sent availablity to recruiter

**Thoughts:** 
* Having a fun time reviewing the different data structures and implementing them.


### Day 13: Tuesday July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* he Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures Course- Building Twitter - Design Questi0n
* The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures Course- Creating an Event System
* Attempted to implement Pomodoro Timer from scratch
* Implemented Podomoro Timer on Codepen from scratch
* Reviewed Web Performance Tips from Syntax
* Started Cloudflare Study Guide
* Reviewed mongoDB replica set and sharding.
* Reviewd horizontal scaling means adding more servers. This means that the data needs to be spread acrosss the servers

**Thoughts:** 
* Going through thte Building Twitter - Design Question helped me get comfortable with answering questions about database design as well as what I would be looking in a framework instead of specifying a particular framework to use for my solution. I also attempted to develop a widget - Pomodoro Timer on paper which was pretty hard. I decided to first get the main HTML layout. Then pseudocode the JS functionality. If given time, then I woud work ont the CSS. This was a bit overwhelming, but got through it. I then went on to implementing it on Codepen. Again, overwhelming, but got the basic functionality and layout down. It will get easier as I keep doing these every day. Overall today was alot of information and new ideas to take it. I'm excited to continue learning tomorrow and practice so that I can feel more comfortable onsite.

### Day 14: Wednesday July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures Course
* Attended Code For SF Meetup
* Read Algorithms To Live By - (Sorting part was awesome)
* Phone Call with Instacart

**Thoughts:** 
Loved the section on Sorting algorithms in Algorithms to Live By Highly recommend this book to every developer. Also continued through the Coding Interview Bootcamp on Udemy. 

### Day 15: THursday July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures Course
* Zumme Pizza Dev Test
* Read Algorithms To Live By

**Thoughts:** 
Didn't complete the whole Zumme Pizza De test because I ran out of time! The first question pretty much was the wedge question that we reviewed on Udemy so it was awesome to apply what I had learned on a test. THe second question consisted of maing multiple making HTTP requests to a server. I knew I was supposed to use promises to get the requests back in order, but ran out of time. The third question, I know I could have completed if I knew I could go back to the previous problems. But that's ok! I gave it my best shot and next time I will be even more prepared.

### Day 16: Friday July 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures Course
* Pinterest Technical Phone Screen

**Thoughts:** 
The Pinterest phone screen was not bad at all! I was supposed to implement a function that receives data from s3. The hardest part here was trying to figure out how big the json string coming in would be using slice. In the end, we figured it out and I made sure to talk through my thought process even if I was stuck. I'm happy with my progress and know that this practice will pay off soon. Just gotta keep pushing! Through the Udemy course, I implemented a binary search tree and that was a little hard! 


### Day 17: Saturday July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Completed The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures Course!!

**Thoughts:** 
The last bit of the Udemy course consisted of implemnting sorting algorithms. Some of them weren't too bad. The merge sort implementation was not hard to implement, but difficult to understand the recursiveness. I loved this course so much and looking forward to using everything that I have learned on my next interview.


### Day 18: Sunday July 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Reviewed Cloudflare Glassdoor Questions
* Codewars Problem

**Thoughts:** 
Went over some of Cloudflare's interview questions on Glasdoor, but there wasn't much context for frontend devs. I'm going to focus on reviewing systems architecture design and APIs type related questions.
