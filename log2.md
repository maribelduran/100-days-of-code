# 100 Days Of Code and Prep

### Day 1: Tuesday June 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Submitted solution to a take home test that consisted of merging log sources
* Researched FrontEnd Masters courses
* Worked on 2 CodeWars Problems
* Replied to recruiter emails
* Worked on personal website
* Read a little on SEO best practices


**Thoughts:** 
* I gave it my best shot on the take home test, but was not able to come up with a good solution. I created a readable stream object to read in the log sources since the source could be huge. However, I was not able to sort the entries together with the node module I was trying to implement. I was transparent with the recruiter about my efforts as well as the learning curve with streams. They provided feedback on my solution. All in all I know I gave it my best and it was good practice! 
* Looking into FrontEnd Master's Practical Algorithm's course!  https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/

**Link to practice problem:** [Duplicate Encoder](http://www.codewars.com/kata/duplicate-encoder/train/javascript)
* Researched Cloudflare
* Added the preload value to the link attribute for stylesheets. This improved mobile performanct at Google PageSpeed Insight. 
* Some notes on SEO best practices: HTTPS, have valuable content, use good meta description and title in head, mobile first ready, and create trust. 


...Did code, but forgot to log

### Day 2 : Monday June 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
* Read articles on Binary Trees and Depth first Serach
* Worked on 1 CodeWars Problem
* Replied to recruiter's email with availability
* Signed up for Udemy's The Coding Interivew Bootcamp: Algorithsm + Data Structures course
* Cleaned up and backed up laptop

**Thoughts:** 
* Read about binary search tress and depth first search. My goal for this week is to implement a binary search including BFS and DFS traversal methods. I also attempted to provide a solution to Codewar's Default Argument's problem. I was asked to write a function that takes a function as an argument, along with an object containing default values for that function's arguments and return another function. I was in the right track about using the callback function to create a new function. However, i didn't how that I could use the Object.apply method to call in the default values if they were not set. I learned alot from this problem and next time I will be able to use the apply method to help with other solutions. It's all about practice! I also signed up for Udemy's Udemy's The Coding Interivew Bootcamp: Algorithsm + Data Structures course. However, I had to clear up my laptop last night to free up space in order for me to use my laptop again lol.
